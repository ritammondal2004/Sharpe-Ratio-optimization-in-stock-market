## üìå Project Overview
This project implements Sharpe Ratio-based financial portfolio optimization using real Indian stock data. The model **maximizes return** per unit of risk under practical constraints such as sector allocation limits, ESG scores, liquidity thresholds, and volatility caps. The optimization is solved using **SLSQP** and visualized through **Monte Carlo** simulation and efficient frontier plots.

## üìà Introduction
Financial portfolio optimization is the backbone of informed investment decision-making. Our project builds on this by maximizing the **Sharpe Ratio**, an industry-standard metric for evaluating risk-adjusted returns. Using data from Indian equities, we formulate a constrained optimization model that reflects real-world investor limitations.

##  Sharpe Ratio Definition

The Sharpe Ratio is a key metric used to evaluate how well an investment is performing compared to the amount of risk it's taking. It was developed by William F. Sharpe, a Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist, and it's widely used in fi nance ‚Äî especially when comparing mutual funds or building optimized portfolios.

In simple terms, the Sharpe Ratio tells you how much return you're getting for every unit of risk you take. It compares your investment returns to a risk-free asset like a fi xed deposit or government bond, and then adjusts that return based on the volatility (or uncertainty) of the investment. 

A **higher Sharpe Ratio** means you're getting better **risk-adjusted returns**, which is a good sign ‚Äî but it also means the investment might be more volatile. So if you're targeting higher returns, you also have to be ready to handle bigger ups and downs. 
The Sharpe ratio's numerator is the difference expected returns over time between realized and a benchmark such as the [risk-free rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) or the performance of a particular investment category. Its denominator is the standard deviation of returns over the same period of time, a measure of volatility and risk. For investors and fund managers, the Sharpe Ratio acts like a performance fi lter ‚Äî helping them decide which funds are truly delivering value without blindly chasing returns that come with too much risk. It‚Äôs especially useful when comparing funds or choosing the most effi cient mix of assets in a portfolio.
The objective function for optimization was defi ned as the negative Sharpe Ratio since [scipy.optimize.minimize()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) minimizes functions by default.

## üîç Literature Review
Rooted in **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** by Harry Markowitz. It relies on mean-variance optimization‚Äîessentially balancing average returns against volatility. This work integrates extensions like:
- ESG considerations
- Liquidity constraints
- Sector allocation caps

We bridge theory and practice by enhancing the mean-variance model to align with fund manager behavior and sustainability requirements.

## üéØ Objective
To allocate weights to a set of stocks such that the portfolio achieves:
- Maximum Sharpe Ratio or maximize net return per unit of risk taken
- Subject to constraints on sector bounds, volatility, ESG scores, and liquidity

### Constraints:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4749c13d-fe3e-4052-bed7-4008fecb1a38)


Used parameter In this model:

- n = number of assets in the portfolio
- Œº·µ¢ = expected mean return of asset i
- Œº = Vector of expected returns of the assets
- Œ£ = Covariance matrix of asset returns 
- COV(i,j) = Covariance between stock i and stock j
- w·µ¢ = weight assigned to asset i (decision variable)
- w = vector of weight allocated (vector of decision variable)

## üß† Parametric Grid Search (NEW SECTION)
To evaluate how varying constraint values impact portfolio performance, we performed a **grid search** across:
- Sector bounds: [10%, 30%, ..., 90%] (with UB > LB)
- Volatility caps: [1%, 6%, ..., 30%]
- ESG minimums: [35, 50, 65, 80]
- Liquidity minimums: [40k to 440k in steps of 80k]

> üßÆ Total combinations tested: **2160**

Each combination was optimized using SLSQP, and results were stored to evaluate which constraint set gave the highest Sharpe Ratio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Calculate expected returns and covariance matrix from daily price data
2. Normalize and structure sector, ESG, and liquidity data
3. Define optimization problem using `scipy.optimize.minimize`
4. Solve for each constraint configuration
5. Optimization Algorithm: SLSQP (Sequential Least Squares Programming)
   - `SLSQP` is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that handles both equality and inequality constraints.
   - It solves a series of quadratic subproblems to move toward an optimum.
   - Iteratively solves a Quadratic Programming subproblem
   - Well-suited for portfolio optimization where constraints are linear or nonlinear.

7. Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Generation and Validation
   - Generate thousands of random portfolios with varying weights.
   - Calculate expected return and volatility for each to plot the **efficient frontier.**
   - Helps validate whether the optimization results are close to the theoretical maximum Sharpe Ratio.
   - Useful for visualizing trade-offs between risk and return across many possible portfolios.

Incorporating ESG, sector, and liquidity constraints makes the solution applicable in real-world asset management. Our results show clear risk-return tradeoffs and how optimal asset allocation shifts under different scenarios.
